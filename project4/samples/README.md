## Installation Instructions

A build script is included for your convenience.  Simply run `./build.sh`.  This will create a binary file `type_checker`.

To run the program, simply call:

`bin/type_checker <filename>`

Type checker test cases are in the folder hw/samples.  The test bench script is included in the type\_checker folder.  Different error codes and messages are reported depending on the type error.

## GitHub Repo

The GitHub repository cited in the config file **is a private repository.** I have sent you a collaborator invitation so you can download and use it.
